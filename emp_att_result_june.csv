Generated Response: To generate the attendance sheet for 3 employees for June 2023, you would need the following information:

1. Employee Name
2. Employee ID
3. Total Working Days (including approved leaves)
4. Total Working Hours (calculated based on working days)
5. Excluding weekends, holidays, and unapproved leaves

Assuming you have the necessary data in a file, you can use Python to read the file, process the data, and generate the attendance sheet in CSV format. Here's an example code snippet to accomplish this task:

```python
import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Read the data from the file
with open('attendance_data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip the header row
    data = list(reader)

# Define the start and end dates for the month
start_date = datetime(2023, 6, 1)
end_date = datetime(2023, 6, 30)

# Initialize the attendance sheet
attendance_sheet = [['Employee Name', 'Employee ID', 'Total Working Days', 'Total Working Hours']]

# Iterate over the employees' data
for row in data:
    employee_name = row[0]
    employee_id = row[1]
    leaves = int(row[2]) if row[2].isdigit() else 0  # Number of approved leaves

    # Calculate the total working days
    total_working_days = (end_date - start_date).days + 1 - leaves

    # Calculate the total working hours
    total_working_hours = total_working_days * 8

    # Add the employee's attendance to the sheet
    attendance_sheet.append([employee_name, employee_id, total_working_days, total_working_hours])

# Write the attendance sheet to a CSV file
with open('attendance_sheet.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(attendance_sheet)
```

Make sure to replace `'attendance_data.csv'` with the actual file path containing the employee data. The code assumes that the file has the following columns: Employee Name, Employee ID, and Number of Approved Leaves.

After running the code, it will generate a CSV file named `'attendance_sheet.csv'` with the desired attendance sheet for the specified month and employees.
